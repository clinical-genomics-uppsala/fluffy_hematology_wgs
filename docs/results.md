# Result files
## DNA
If any **T**umor and **N**ormals samples were included in the following results file will be produced.
`{sample}` is replaced with the sample name and `{type}` is replaced with the sample type (T/N/R, where T=Tumor, N=Normal, R=RNA).

|**File**|**File type**|**Type**|**Description**|
|-|-|-|-|
|`Results/MultiQC_TN.html`| `.html`| TN | Aggregated QC-reports for both Normal and Tumor samples|

## RNA
If **R**NA samples have been included in the run the following results file will be produced.
`{sample}` is replaced with the sample name and `{type}` is replaced with the sample type (T/N/R, where T=Tumor, N=Normal, R=RNA).
